## Tutorials and Lessons

* [3d game shaders for beginners](https://lettier.github.io/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners/)
  has many great explanations of many graphics techniques. It is OpenGL based but
  the explanations are illustrated well and so it should be possible to adapt them
  to WebGL.

* [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/): Modern OpenGL lessons

  These may or may not be useful. Though the APIs are similar OpenGL is not WebGL. For one OpenGL
  is a C based library. Another issue is OpenGL has many more features than WebGL and the
  shader languages have many differences. Still, many of the ideas and techniques shown are
  just as useful in WebGL as they are in OpenGL.

## Helpers / Extensions

* [Spector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spectorjs/denbgaamihkadbghdceggmchnflmhpmk?hl=en): An extension to show all your WebGL calls

* [Shader Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shader-editor/ggeaidddejpbakgafapihjbgdlbbbpob?hl=en): An extension that lets you view and edit shaders in live web pages.

* [WebGL Insight](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webgl-insight/djdcbmfacaaocoomokenoalbomllhnko?hl=en): An extension to let you see WebGL usage

* [webgl-helpers](https://greggman.github.io/webgl-helpers/): Scripts to help with WebGL

## Libraries

* [twgl](https://twgljs.org): A library to help make WebGL less verbose.

* [three.js](https://threejs.org): the most popular JavaScript 3D library.

* [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) A WebGL game engine with game editor

* [regl](https://regl.party/): A stateless functional WebGL library.

## Specs

* [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/): The WebGL spec

* [OpenGL ES 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/2.0/es_full_spec_2.0.pdf): The spec WebGL is based on.

* [GLSL ES 1.0](https://www.khronos.org/files/opengles_shading_language.pdf): The shader language spec for WebGL

## Fun

* [Shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com): Amazing fragment shaders produced under extreme constraints

  Warning: The shaders on shadertoy.com are usually not the kind of shader that are used in production
  WebGL apps. Still there are many techniques to be learned from their examples.

* [glslsandbox.com](https://glslsandbox.com): The original fragment shader playground.

* [vertexshaerart.com](https://vertexshaderart.com): The vertex shader version of glslsandbox.
